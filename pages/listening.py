After watching the video about the 100 most common words in Spanish, I realized how important it is to focus on these basic words when starting to learn the language. Words like yo (I), tú (you), es (is), and tengo (I have) appear in almost every sentence. For example, with just a few words like yo, tengo, and amigos (friends), I can already say Yo tengo amigos (I have friends). It made me understand that I don’t need a huge vocabulary to start forming useful sentences. Just knowing these core words can help me communicate in simple but effective ways.
                                 
Another thing I learned is that many of these common words are also connectors that make sentences flow, like pero (but), porque (because), and y (and). For instance, I can say Me gusta la música porque es bonita (I like the music because it is beautiful) just by combining words from the list. The video showed me that by mastering these frequent words first, I can understand a big part of everyday conversations and even guess the meaning of sentences when I don’t know every word. It made me feel more confident about learning Spanish step by step.

After watching a Spanish "day in the life" vlog, I noticed how much I could understand just by recognizing common words and phrases. The vlogger used simple sentences like me levanto (I get up), desayuno (I have breakfast), and voy al trabajo (I go to work), which helped me follow along even when I didn’t catch every word. For example, when they said Ahora voy al supermercado (Now I’m going to the supermarket), I could guess the meaning because of the familiar word supermercado and the routine context. It made me realize that daily life videos are great for picking up real phrases that people use every day.

I also learned some useful expressions that I can practice myself, like tengo que (I have to) and un poco (a little). The vlogger said things like Tengo que limpiar un poco (I have to clean a little), and I could see the action while hearing the words, which made it easier to remember. Watching their routine helped me feel more connected to how Spanish is used naturally, and I liked seeing the mix of casual phrases and common verbs like hacer, comer, and salir. It motivated me to keep watching more vlogs to improve my listening skills and learn new chunks of language in a fun way.''')
