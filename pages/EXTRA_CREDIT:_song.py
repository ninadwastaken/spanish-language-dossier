My favorite song in Spanish is Dime Tú Me Fuiste (DTMF) by Bad Bunny. I really like it because it has a great rhythm and a beautiful melody. I first heard it last month, and now I listen to it almost every day. The song talks about love, heartbreak, and feelings of missing someone. When I listen to it, I feel relaxed and connected to the music. I also enjoy it because it helps me learn new words and phrases in Spanish while having fun. Bad Bunny’s style is unique and modern, and I think that makes the song very special.

Here are some lyrics I learned:

"Dime tú, ¿por qué te fuiste?": "Tell me, why did you leave?"

"Mi corazón no te olvida": "My heart doesn’t forget you"

"Quiero volver a tus brazos": "I want to return to your arms"

Some new words I learned from the song:

dime (tell me)

amor (love)

corazón (heart)

sueño (dream)

noche (night)

perder (to lose)

volver (to return)

This song motivates me to keep learning Spanish because every time I listen to it, I understand a little more. Music makes language learning fun and memorable for me!
